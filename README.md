# build css files
To build css files, after CLONE or PULL of the repository, do the next steps:
1. Open terminal
2. CLONE or PULL repository
3. Navigate to the root of the project
4. run 'npm run build-all' command to build main.css file
4. run 'npm run build-bootstrap' command to build bootstrap.css file

This will create two files - main.css and bootstrap.css that are main holder of website styles.
